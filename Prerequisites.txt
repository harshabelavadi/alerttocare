Prerequisites:

Pgadmin Database make sure you have correct database name username and password 
and port(usually 5432) is free[it can be checked using command -> netstat -ano | findstr "port_number"], 
if the port is being used by some other process then either use different port number which is free or 
terminate the process that is using port number 5432. 

Run Pgadmin, go to pgadmin and create two databases, one for development named “alerttocare” and another for testing named "alerttocare_testdb".

Extract the project to a folder. Import it as maven project. Do maven clean and maven install,  after that maven build.

Finally Run the project as Spring boot.
